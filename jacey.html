    <p>Jacey Zimmerman is a sophomore at Millard South.  After moving here after her mother's divorce four years ago she decided to give up playing basketball and participating in dance and has concentrated on her volleyball and softball skills.  She plays volleyball for school in the fall and for a club team in the winter.  Softball with her select team is year-round but most of their games are played in the Spring and Summer.  There is no off-season though as team practices and pitching lessons happen multiple times a week year-round.

    <p>Jacey applied for and was accepted into the Early College Program with Millard South and upon graduation she will have earned enough credits to graduate high school with an associates degree.  Jacey is completing as many college credits as she can in high school as she aspires to be a Pediatric Surgeon someday.  This has been a goal of hers ever since a dirt bike accident that shattered her arm in 8th grade.  Though all of the hospital stays, surgeries and physical therapy she gained an appreciation for this line of work.
