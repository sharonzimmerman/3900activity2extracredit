# 3900-Activity2
This web page is for Activity 2 and talks about me and my family.
The index page specifically talks about me (Sharon) and I also created a page for each of my children, Bryan and Jacey.
There is also a css file with my styles.

I have 2 pictures on each of my children's pages.  I had decided I wanted those pictures side by side and therefore made some additional changes to make the pictures side by side in a grid vs them being in line vertically.
